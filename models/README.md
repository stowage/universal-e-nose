# Models Directory

This directory stores trained universal recognition models.

## File Structure

- `universal_model.pkl` - Main trained model file
- `model_backups/` - Model backup files (optional)

## Important Notes

- **Do not manually edit** model files
- **Model compatibility**: Models are specific to the Python version and library versions used during training
- **Backup strategy**: The system automatically saves models after each training session
- **Universal optimization**: Models are trained with universal features and hierarchical classification
